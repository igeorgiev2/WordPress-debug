# WordPress-debug

Debug PHP code in WordPress pages

The default user roles in WordPress:

Subscriber, Contributor, Author, Editor, Administrator.


Naturally, the Administrator has the rights over the entire system. We will make a script that allows the Administrator to review each page for errors without affecting other users. You can test the simple solution by passing it inside the functions.php file of your theme. Put it to the header to print errors, warnings and notices.
